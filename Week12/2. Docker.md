## What is docker?

Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run (code, runtime, system tools, system libraries - anything that can be installed on a server). This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of the environment (No "It runs on my computer" problems). They are lightweight, open and secure.

## Installing on Windows

Recently in stable release. Can be downloaded here : https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi . But to be noted: Docker needs 64-bit Windows 10 and Hyper-V (See here how to install Hyper-V:  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_install).

Installation directions for windows : https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/.

Also available on beta channel (includes new features but is not as robust as the stable channel): https://download.docker.com/win/beta/InstallDocker.msi
Documentation for experimental featuers can be found here: https://github.com/docker/docker/tree/master/experimental.

## Virtual Box install (OS X & Windows)
Possible to run docker through virtual box (https://www.virtualbox.org/). Download docker-toolbox (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) that takes care of everything for you (Set up docker client, virtual box, Docker-machine and Docker-compose).

## Installing on Linux
Docker runs natively on linux so there is no need for virtual machines. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux for more information.

## Docker Images/containers
Docker uses an image system to run containers. Each container thus has an image behind himself, it can be said that an image is a snapshot of the container. The image describes the behavior of the container, its operating system, what commands are run when it is started etc. There exist a lot of images, they are hosted on https://hub.docker.com/. When running an image, we have a container.
When the docker run command is executed, if the image is not stored locally on the machine, it searches on Docker Hub for the image and pulls it from there if success in finding it.

It is also possible to make new images with Dockerfiles, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerimages/ for reference.
The image is built with the docker build command (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and it is possible to push (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) the newly created image to docker hub with docker push command, then other people can access the image too.

## Running Docker
When all is set up, it is easy to test and run some simple containers, examples: https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerizing/, https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#step-4-explore-the-application-and-run-examples.  
Docker run command can be used with flags, see a list of them here https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#step-4-explore-the-application-and-run-examples  
  
Some of the most common are:
* -d : Detached, runs the container in background.
* -v : Mounting volume in the container on a folder in the file system on the machine that is running the container.
* -it : Runs interactive shell inside the container. (Example: *"docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash"* - runs ubuntu and starts a bash shell with stdin/stdout/stderr attached.)  
  
It can be useful to use *"docker exec"* to run commands inside a container that is running. To start a bash shell inside a running container it is for example possible to use: *"docker exec -it nameofcontainer bash"*.  


## Docker-compose
Good and easy to use when using many containers that interact with each other. Uses docker-compose.yml file that describes the docker units and the dependencies between them.
See https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/.
When we have a docker-compose.yml file ready, we can simply run the command *docker-compose up* to run all units described in the yaml file.

## Docker-machine
https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/  
Assists when running docker containers on virtual or cloud machines. If we need to user virtual box to run the docker daemon (if using mac os e.g.), then docker-machine abstracts that for us. We simply tune docker-machine to the virtual machine and then the docker-machine commands we run are runned on the virtual machine.
Docker machine also has drivers for managing docker instances on cloud services. Example (Azure driver): https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/azure/
To set up machine running with docker on azure we use the command "docker-machine create --driver azure" and give it the subscription id to the azure account and a name for the machine.

A convenient workflow is to have a docker machine running on a virtual machine for dev environment and another one running on azure/aws or other cloud service with production environment. Then it is easy to switch between machines with the "docker-machine env nameofmachine" command.

# Gotcha's 
* If docker is run on a VirtualBox machine, then that machine has an IP address that is needed to use to get access to the containers. To be able to use localhost to access the containers the command *"docker-machine ssh default -L portno:localhost:portno"* where 'portno' is the port number the container is exposing. Then it is possible to connect to the service that is running on port number 'portno' in the container through localhost. (For example: docker-machine ssh default -L 5601:localhost:5601 to access kibana).
